  <h2>Starting My Journey</h2>
  <p><em>April 11, 2025</em></p>
  <p>
    Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This site is where I'll share my works;
    coding projects, artwork, and other creative experiments. Right now, I'm just starting out,
    but every project you see here is part of my journey to grow as a developer and artist.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is simple: keep learning, keep building, and keep creating. Whether it's
    a website, a painting, or a new skill, I'll log it here over time. 
    Think of this blog as both a portfolio and a personal quest log.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks for stopping byâ€”and stay tuned, there's a lot more to come.

                    I am a passionate coder and artist who loves to blend technology with creativity.
                    My journey began with a fascination for how things work, leading me to explore various programming languages and artistic mediums.
                    Through this website, I aim to showcase my projects that reflect my skills and artistic vision.
