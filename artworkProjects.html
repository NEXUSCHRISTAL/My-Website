                <h3>Surrender</h3>
                <p>This painting is meant to show how i see my bestfriend. He is ambitious, but out of fear of not being perfect, he doesn't give it his all. He is self-aware of his strengths and weaknessess but he is currently stock and unwilling to push himself. I hope he doesn't get mad at this description. </p>

                <p>This painting was part of my final project piece for my college work. This has been one of my least favorites to paint but for some reason, it has been the first to be sold.</p>

                 These two are mine and my bestfriend's <abbr title="Original Characters">OCs</abbr>. I painted this to show that we are not the same but we are also not that different.

                <h3>Interrupted</h3>
                <p>This painting is about how i see myself. I usually don't have the will to do anything because i usually get bored of things quickly or i am not good at want i want to do, whick is not good for my ego, like at all. But i am starting to try. "Just try" has been something i kept hearing or seeing constanstly so i did. And the result is beginning to speak for it's self.</p>

                <h3>Untitled</h3>
                <p>I realised the kind of love i had for myself when this painting was complete. I just wanted to see what i looked like to myself, but i got to understand myself better with this. To be truthful, i never really understand why people where insecure about their body. It stroke me as strange, until i kept trying to cover up my "inperfections". I decided this was meant to help me understand and be vulnerable with myself so i left in what i felt wasn't right about me.</p>

                <!-- <p>This needs a description.</p> -->
                <p>I would say this is my favorite painting so far. Simply because of what it represents to me. Hope, Want, Desire. I got to have these feelings for the first time in a very long time. I wasn't stock or too afraid my future and what it could be, i was actully living because i wanted to try knew things.</p>
